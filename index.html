        <h5>Writting is my favourite activity</h5>
        <p>I like writting, because I feel it helps me <b>de-stress</b> in any given situation.
           writing has been shown to help people <b>communicate</b> highly complex ideas more effectively.
           It also allows greater precision in communicating ideas.

        <blockquote>Objective-J is a programming language developed as part of the Cappuccino 
            web development framework. Its syntax is nearly identical to the Objective-C syntax and 
            it shares with JavaScript the same relationship that Objective-C has with the C programming
             language: that of being a strict, but small, superset; adding traditional inheritance 
             and Smalltalk/Objective-C style dynamic dispatch.
