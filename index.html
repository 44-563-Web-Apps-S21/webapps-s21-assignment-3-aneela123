        <h5>Writting is my favourite activity</h5>
        <p>I like writting, because I feel it helps me <b>de-stress</b> in any given situation.
           writing has been shown to help people <b>communicate</b> highly complex ideas more effectively.
           It also allows greater precision in communicating ideas.
